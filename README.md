This is an Ionic React application that reads data from a static XML file. The application also updates the DOM on the homepage every 60 seconds with a joke from a Chuck Norris joke API. Both the XML file and the JSON response from the API are queried by using the axios library and asynchronous javascript. To run the application clone the repo onto your computer and navigate to the folder using the terminal. Once you have navigated to the folder download the node dependencies by running npm install. Once you have downloaded the dependencies you can run the app with ionic serve.
